## Progress
* 214/501 opcodes emulated
* Have reached a point where the Boot ROM loops indefinitely as the PPU has not been implemented yet

## Build
This program was built and tested with:  
* Windows 10 22H2
  * mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc 15.2.0-1

It will most likely work with newer or older versions and other operating systems, however, there may be some breaking changes that cause it not to build or run.
